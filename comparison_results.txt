Chain 3 Exception: lkj_corr_cholesky_lpdf: Random variable[2] is 0, but must be positive! (in '/var/folders/js/f3hp53z954v4l_fzq7td7bp40000gn/T/RtmpIiQ8OW/model-b4b0d2abcc6.stan', line 142, column 4 to column 32)
Chain 3 If this warning occurs sporadically, such as for highly constrained variable types like covariance matrices, then the sampler is fine,
Chain 3 but if this warning occurs often then your model may be either severely ill-conditioned or misspecified.
