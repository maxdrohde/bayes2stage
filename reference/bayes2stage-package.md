# bayes2stage: Bayesian Analysis of Two-Stage Designs with Longitudinal Data

Tools for designing and analyzing two-stage studies with longitudinal
data. Supports outcome-dependent sampling (ODS) and BLUP-dependent
sampling (BDS) designs where expensive covariates are measured on a
subset of subjects. Bayesian model fitting uses 'Stan' via the
'instantiate' package for mixed effects models with imputation. Also
provides ascertainment-corrected maximum likelihood (ACML) estimation.
