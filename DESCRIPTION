Description: Tools for designing and analyzing two-stage studies with
    longitudinal data. Supports outcome-dependent sampling (ODS) and
    BLUP-dependent sampling (BDS) designs where expensive covariates are
    measured on a subset of subjects. Bayesian model fitting uses 'Stan' via
    the 'instantiate' package for mixed effects models with imputation.
    Also provides ascertainment-corrected maximum likelihood (ACML) estimation
    and legacy support for 'NIMBLE'-based fitting.
